# Title of the project:

PacMen Exercise

# Description of the project:

This project controls Pacman through the arrow keys on the keyboard. They will move Pacman around the screen. Pacman will stop at the boundaries of the small blocks on the screen and at the ends of the viewport. This exercise was originally triggered through a mouse click, automating Pacman to move back and forth across the screen. I added directionality to allow Pacman to move vertically and made Pacman triggered by the keyboard, and added sound to the movements.

# How to Run:

- Clone this repo
- Open the index.html file in a browser
- Move pacman with the top, right, left, and down arrows on the keyboard

# Roadmap of future improvements:

- Add ghosts and a maze to better simulate a Pacman game
- Make Pacman automatically move in a direction when you click a direction rather than needing to constantly click
